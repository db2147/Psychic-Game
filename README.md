In the psychic game the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.&nbsp; The user gets a total of 9 guesses which can be entered on the keyboard.&nbsp; When the player wins, the Wins counter will be updated and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). &nbsp; When the player loses the losses counter will increase and restart the game (without refreshing the page).
